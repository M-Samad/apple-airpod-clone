            The new Apple‑designed H2 chip is the force behind AirPods Pro and
            its advanced audio performance. It works in concert with a
            custom‑built driver and amplifier to deliver crisp, clear high notes
            and deep, rich bass in stunning definition — so every sound is more
            vivid than&nbsp;ever.
